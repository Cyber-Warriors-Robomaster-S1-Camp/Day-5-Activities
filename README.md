# Day-5-Activities

On Day 5, students will learn how to use line detection with Robomaster S1 Robots.  Students will create a race track in their room with masking tape, and create a line following app that makes the robots loop around the race track.  Students may add modifications and extensions if wanted, and if time permits, extensions may be created.
